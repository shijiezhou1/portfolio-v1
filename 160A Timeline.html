               Working Title: HUMAN EVOLUTION IN COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY<br/>
               
Concept: <br/>
A 21st, century, we are using a more advance communication tools. The way of how we deliver the message is totally different than before. The printing press, the book, and the electronic device are changing the way we live. The evolution performance is broken into to two arguments point. The audience is playing a role of how to communicate to the other side. The specific concept of video would display in front the audiences. The detection is to check if the audience is getting close to each other for the connection or communication. The level of intimacy or color would change as they walk close to each other. The idea is to develop a tool to communicate our deepest feelings rather than literal interpretation
