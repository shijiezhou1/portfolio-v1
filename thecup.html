            <h3>The Cup</h3>
            <p class="text-left">Based on the information and daily communication strategies, I had created a piece of
                artwork – Canning cup that
                it has a conceptual relationship about what Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby had stated. We are seeing all
                kinds of
                invention, such as a helicopter or the airplane, and all those ideas come from our nature in reality.
                Both authors
                mention that, “Speculative design props function as physical Synecdoche, parts representing wholes
                designed to
                prompt speculation in the viewer about the world these objects belong to” (Dunne & Raby). Humans mime
                their structure
                in order to make the transportation. Those productions could seem as the ideas of speculative everything
                when humans
                do not invent that transportation plentifully. What I make is a piece of the cup with special handle on
                it. It
                does not look like a cup any for most of us since it has the handle aside like a bird's mouth. The
                feature of this
                cup is to solve the problem of dripping water from the cans drink. For instance, a freezing coke could
                make your
                table wet. However, this cup can prevent this issue. The edge of the cup has four small obstacles to
                stabilize
                the canning drink inside. It works not only at home but also outside in your car, and the design of the
                handle
                is more convenient to catch up table or hard cardboard. Thus, this cup is an alternative way to improve
                the quality
                of our daily life. </p>
            <p class="text-left">Moreover, our invention derives from the need of environment. The limitation tells that
                we need a container in order
                to carry more water. Our human develops and explores what it is important to our life. The best way to
                solve that
                it is to have something to store water in the ancient era. Marshall McLuhan states, “Environment are not
                passive
                wrappings, but are, active processes which are invisible.” (Marshall p68). All the media occurs at the
                point of
                view of us, which mean we shape the way how it is. There is no metaphor and any prediction to tell those
                people
                to make an item. All of them are based on the conceptual art and ideal form in order to present it to
                us. My second
                pieces called Powder Container. This container does not specify what to put on it. Instead, you can fill
                with the
                material that each time consumes 50 grams, which it is no limit to use. What it relates is the
                convenient function
                to save our time. The container can load up to 150 grams and use them separately. For social
                perspective, people
                prefer to use less time to solve their organizational issue and this proposition can satisfy what they
                need. </p>
